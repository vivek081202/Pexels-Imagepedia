# Pexels-Imagepedia @Pexels [https://github.com/pexels]
It is a simple web application coded purely in python to search queried requests of images and display into your webspace or wherever you want.

This app uses the streamlit library to create a user interface, and the requests library to make an API call to the Pexels API. The search_images() function takes a search query as an argument and returns a JSON object with the search results. The display_images() function takes a list of images as an argument and displays them in the app.

Please note that you should use your own API key, you can get it from https://www.pexels.com/api/new/
